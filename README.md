My concept for my non-linear narrative is that i want to make a short story horror analog in twine like maybe try to trick people into thinking its a cute kawaii adventure but the more you play the more you see through of whats happening like maybe i can try to make two endings like one the good (bad ending ) you save your friends and have a happy picnic together in the end . or two Bad ending ( good ending ) you see that everything is fake and eveyrone that you saw wasnt real or it was just an imagination of yours like maybe having the main character go on a drug overdose i dont know i dont think it could be a good story .

So maybe i want to make an anlog horror story like you have to escape the entity around you and you need to findnitems to survive and not get caught by the entity like i think it would be really interesting me to make so i want to try to do a short story for a bit but try to make a deep lore out of it and also try to make the story intersting and not boring for the audience well thats all i have to say i hope you guys like my work soon because i need to work on it and i feel like its gonna be hard but hopefully i finished sooooon.
